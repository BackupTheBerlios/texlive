2001-09-14  Fabrice Popineau  <Fabrice.Popineau@supelec.fr>

	* RootPage.cpp: rearrange the logic behind the setting of paths.
	
	* TPMspecial.cpp: use the new GetSafePathName() function when
	adding directory to the PATH environment variable.

	* TeXInstall.cpp (DoCopyFiles): if WinNT, set TEMP to point to the
	newly TEXMFTEMP created directory.
	(GetSafePathName): Returns short path name under Win9X. Use it in
	various places.

	* TPM.cpp (GetSpecialFile): try to catenate the remote source
	url if not an url. Then try to download.

	delegate file anymore.

	* TPM.cpp (AddRequiredBy): do not add the same key twice. Possible
	bug there (why should any key be added twice? But this is the case
	for `adobestd' required by `tex-latex')
	(DeSelect): Deselection based on count of RequiredBy. If
	RequiredBy more than once, then do not deselect, else deselect.
	(Select): Selection based on maintenance mode: do not select
	required packages if up-to-date in maintenance mode.

2001-08-06  Fabrice Popineau  <Fabrice.Popineau@supelec.fr>

	* TeXInstall.cpp (DoConfiguration): language.dat was build	
	after mktexlsr has been run, which is wrong.
	(DoConfiguration): fmtutil can't be run with `--missing' option,
	even in maintenance mode, because the user might have added some
	new language for example.

	* Environnement.cpp: add a fix for non-existent autoexec.bat.

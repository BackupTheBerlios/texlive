BUGS: The bug list for dvipdfmx
===============================

Last modified: April 4, 2002


  o CID-Keyed Font (CIDFontType 0)

    CID-Keyed font support is limited to CFF/OpenType format font.
    Only Type 2 charstring is supported. `random' operator is not implemented
    yet.

    Does not write glyph metrics such as W, W2.

    Does not write vertical glyph metrics, /DW2, and /W2.

  o TrueType (CIDFontType 2)

    GSUB support:

     Ignores Script and LangSys table. Only `vert' feature is supported.
     `smple' and `trad' support for Chinese, `jp78', `jp83', and `jp90'
     variant support for Japanese may be needed.

  o CMap

    Encodings with variable length such as EUC are not allowed in MetaPost
    PostScript. Strings like <4040> (`@@' in EUC-JP encoding) are always
    interpreted as a single double-byte character, hence will cause invalid
    character error. Treatment of codespacerange is incorrect:
    Codespacerange <00> <FF> should be interpreted as single-byte range,
    not 0x0000 - 0x00ff.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xdvi
is a program which runs under the X window system. It is used to preview
.I dvi
files, such as are produced by
.BR tex (1).
.PP
This program has the capability of showing the file shrunken by various
(integer) factors, and also has a ``magnifying glass'' which allows one
to see a small part of the unshrunk image momentarily. It has also support
for
#ifhyper
hyperlinks in DVI files (see section HYPERLINKS below),
#endif
#ift1
direct rendering of Postscript<tm> Type1 fonts (see section T1LIB below), and
#endif
source specials in the .dvi file (see section SOURCE SPECIALS below).
.PP
Before displaying any page or part thereof, it checks to see if the
.I dvi
file has changed since the last time it was displayed.  If this is the case,
then
.B xdvi
will reinitialize itself for the new
.I dvi
file.  For this reason, exposing parts of the
.B xdvi
window while \*(Te\& is running should be avoided.  This feature allows you
to preview many versions of the same file while running
.B xdvi
only once.
#ifbuttons
.PP
In addition to using keystrokes to move within the file,
.B xdvi
provides buttons on the right side of the window, which are synonymous
with various sequences of keystrokes.
#endif
#ifps
.PP
.B xdvi
can show PostScript<tm> specials by any of three methods.
It will try first to use Display PostScript<tm>, then NeWS, then it
will try to use Ghostscript to render the images.  All of these options
depend on additional software to work properly; moreover, some of them
may not be compiled into this copy of
.BR xdvi .
.PP
For performance reasons,
.B xdvi
does not render PostScript specials in the magnifying glass.
#endif
#ifselfile
.PP
If
.I dvi_file
is not specified, a file-selection widget is popped up for you to choose the
.I dvi
file.
#endif
.SH OPTIONS
In addition to specifying the
.I dvi
file (with or without the
.B .dvi
extension),
.B xdvi
supports the following command line options.  If the option begins with a
.RB ` + '
instead of a
.RB ` \- ',
the option is restored to its default value.  By default, these options can
be set via the resource names given in parentheses in the description of
each option.
.TP
.BI + page
Specifies the first page to show.  If
.B +
is given without a number, the last page is assumed; the first page is
the default.
#ifps
.TP
.B \-allowshell
.RB ( .allowShell )
This option enables the shell escape in PostScript specials.
(For security reasons, shell escapes are disabled by default.)
This option should be rarely used; in particular it should not be used just
to uncompress files: that function is done automatically if the file name
ends in
.BR .Z ,
.BR .gz ,
or
.BR .bz2 .
Shell escapes are always turned off if the
.B \-safer
option is used.
#endif
.TP
.BI \-altfont " font"
.RB ( .altFont )
Declares a default font to use when the font in the
.I dvi
file cannot be found.  This is useful, for example, with PostScript <tm> fonts.
.TP
.BI \-background " color"
.RB ( .background )
Determines the color of the background.  Same as
.BR -bg .
#ifhyper
.TP
.BI \-base " base URL"
.RB ( .urlBase )
Sets the base URL value that external links given in the
.I dvi
file are assumed relative to - normally this should be the URL
of the document itself (?).
#endif
.TP
.BI \-bd " color"
.RB ( .borderColor )
Determines the color of the window border.
.TP
.BI \-bg " color"
.RB ( .background )
Determines the color of the background.
.TP
.BI \-bordercolor " color"
Same as
.BR -bd .
.TP
.BI \-borderwidth " width"
.RB ( .borderWidth )
Specifies the width of the border of the window.  Same as
.BR -bw .
#ifhyper
.TP
.BI \-browser " WWWbrowser"
.RB ( .wwwBrowser )
Defines the World Wide Web browser to be used to handle external URL's,
for example mosaic.  If neither the command-line option nor the X
resource are set, uses the environment variable WWWBROWSER.
#endif
.TP
.BI \-bw " width"
.RB ( .borderWidth )
Specifies the width of the border of the window.
.TP
.B \-copy
.RB ( .copy )
Always use the
.I copy
operation when writing characters to the display.
This option may be necessary for correct operation on a color display, but
overstrike characters will be incorrect.
#ifgrey
If greyscale anti-aliasing is in use, the
.B \-copy
operation will disable the use of colorplanes and make overstrikes come
out incorrectly.
#endif
See also
.BR \-thorough .
.TP
.BI \-cr " color"
.RB ( .cursorColor )
Determines the color of the mouse cursor.  The default is the color of the page
border.
.TP
.BI \-debug " bitmask"
.RB ( .debugLevel )
If nonzero, prints additional information on standard output.  The
bitmask is specified as a decimal number. Multiple values can
be specified by adding the respective numbers; e.g. to debug all
all file searching and opening commands, use 4000
(= 2048 + 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 32). Use -1 to turn on debugging
of everything (this will produce huge output).
The individual bits/numbers have the following meanings:
.nf
.sp 1n
.ta 1i 2i
	1	Bitmaps
	2	DVI translation
	4	PK fonts
	8	Batch mode: Exit after reading the DVI file
	16	Events
	32	File opening
	64	Interaction with the PostScript interpreter
	128	Kpathsea stat(2) calls
	256	Kpathsea hash table lookups
	512	Kpathsea path definitions
	1024	Kpathsea path expansion
	2048	Kpathsea searches
	4096	Hyperref specials
	8192	Hyperref anchor info
	16384	Source specials
	32768	Client mode for forward search
	65536	T1 lib
	131072	More verbose T1 lib messages
.sp 1n
.fi
Some of the Kpathsea debugging options are actually provided by Kpathsea;
see the Debugging section in the Kpathsea manual for more information on
these.
.TP
.BI \-density " density"
.RB ( .densityPercent )
Determines the density used when shrinking bitmaps for fonts.
A higher value produces a lighter font.  The default value is 40.
#ifgrey
If greyscaling is in use, this argument does not apply; use
.B \-gamma
instead.
#endif
See also the
.RB ` S '
keystroke.
Same as
.BR \-S .
.TP
.BI \-display " host" : display
Specifies the host and screen to be used for displaying the
.I dvi
file.  By default this is obtained from the environment variable
.SB DISPLAY.
.TP
.BI \-editor " editor"
.RB ( .editor )
Specifies the editor that will be invoked when the
.I source-special()
action is triggered (by default via CTRL-Mouse 1).
The argument to this option is a format string in which occurrences of
.RB `` %f ''
are replaced by the file name, occurrences of
.RB `` %l ''
are replaced by the line number within the file, and optional
occurrences of
.RB `` %c ''
are replaced by the column number within the line.
If no
.RB `` %f ''
or
.RB `` %l ''
occurs in the string, a warning is given
.\" NOTE: non-k xdvi doesn't give a warning in this case, but silently appends
.\" the format strings. This is better for compatibility with the (X)EDITOR
.\" environment variables, but previous xdvik versions had different format
.\" strings (%s for filename, %d for linenumber) so we'd better warn people
.\" still using these. People should probably just switch to using the xdvi
.\" editor resource instead of (X)EDITOR.
and the missing designators
are appended.
.sp
If neither the option nor the X resource
.I .editor
is specified, the following environment variables are checked
to determine the editor command:
.BR XEDITOR ,
.BR VISUAL ,
and
.B EDITOR 
(in this sequence). If the string is found as the value
of the
.SB VISUAL
or
.SB EDITOR
environment variables, then
.RI `` "xterm -e "''
is prepended to the string; if the editor is specified by other means, then
it must be in the form of a shell command to pop up an X window with an
editor in it. If none of these variables is set, the command
.RI `` "xterm -e vi %s +%d"''
is used and a warning message is given.
.sp
A new instance of the editor is started each time this command is used;
therefore it is preferrable to use an editor that can be invoked in
`client' mode to load new files into the same instance. Example
settings are:
.sp
.I emacsclient --no-wait +%l %f
(older Emacsen),
.sp
.I gnuclient -q +%l %f
(XEmacs and newer Emacsen)
.sp
.I nc +%l %f
(nedit)
.sp
Note that those strings need to be enclosed
into quotes when using them on the command-line
to protect them from the shell; when using them
as argument for the
.I .editor
resource in an X resource file, no quotes should be used.
.sp
.B NOTE ON SECURITY:
The argument of this option isn't executed as a shell command,
but via
.I exec()
to prevent evil tricks with the contents of source specials.
Execution of the
.I \-editor
command is disabled when the
.I \-safer
option is used.
#ifbuttons
.TP
.B \-expert
.RB ( .expert )
Prevent the buttons from appearing.  See also the
.RB ` x '
keystroke.
#endif
.TP
.BI \-fg " color"
.RB ( .foreground )
Determines the color of the text (foreground).
.TP
.BI \-foreground " color"
Same as
.BR -fg .
#ifbuttons
.TP
.BI \-font " font"
.RB ( *font )
Sets the font for use in the buttons.
#endif
#ifgrey
.TP
.BI \-gamma " gamma"
.RB ( .gamma )
Controls the interpolation of colors in the greyscale anti-aliasing color
palette.  Default value is 1.0.  For 0 <
.I gamma
< 1, the fonts will be lighter (more like the background), and for
.I gamma
> 1, the fonts will be darker (more like the foreground).  Negative
values behave the same way, but use a slightly different algorithm.
For color and grayscale displays; for monochrome, see
.BR \-density .
See also the
.RB ` S '
keystroke.
#endif
.TP
.BI \-rulecolor " color"
.RB ( .ruleColor )
Determines the color of the rules used for the the magnifier
#ifgrid
and the `grid'
#endif
(default: foreground color).
.TP
.BI \-geometry " geometry"
.RB ( *geometry )
Specifies the initial geometry of the window.
#ifghost
.TP
.BI \-gspalette " palette"
.RB ( .palette )
Specifies the palette to be used when using Ghostscript for rendering
PostScript specials.  Possible values are
.BR Color ,
.BR Greyscale ,
and
.BR Monochrome .
The default is
.BR Color .
.TP
.B \-gsalpha
.RB ( .gsAlpha )
Causes
.B Ghostscript
to be called with the
.B x11alpha
driver instead of the
.B x11
driver.  The
.B x11alpha
driver enables anti-aliasing in PostScript specials, for a nicer appearance.
It is available on newer versions of
.BR Ghostscript .
This option can also be toggled with the
.RB ` V '
keystroke.
#endif
.TP
\fB\-sourceposition\fP \fIline\fP[\fB:\fP\fIcol\fP][\ ]\fIfilename\fP
This option makes xdvi start in `client mode' to perform a
`forward search'. The main dvi file
.I dvi_file
is specified on the command line as usual. `Forward search' means that
xdvi will try to open the page in
.I dvi_file
corresponding to the
.I line
(optionally also the
.IR column )
and
.I filename
of the .tex source, and highlight the place found by drawing a rectangle
in
.I highlight
colour (see the
.I \-hl
option) around the corresponding text.
(This only works when the
.I dvi_file
has been prepared with source special information;
see the section SOURCE SPECIALS for more information on this.)
.sp
`Client mode' means that if there is already
another instance of xdvi running on this X display and displaying the
same
.IR dvi_file ,
a new instance started with the
.I -sourceposition
option will only notify that running instance to perform the forward
search, and exit after that. This way, other programs such such as
text editors may invoke xdvi in `client mode' to jump to a specific
place in the .dvi file corresponding to the current mouse cursor position
in the .tex file.
.sp
The argument for
.I filename
should be a string with the same extension as the file name used
for the source specials in the
.I dvi
file. The space before
.I filename
is only needed if the filename starts
with a digit.  When the space is used, the argument
needs to be encosed in quotes to prevent the shell from
misinterpreting the space as argument separator.
.TP
.BI \-hl " color"
.RB ( .highlight )
Determines the color of the page border.  The default is the foreground color.
.TP
.B \-hush
.RB ( .Hush )
Causes
.B xdvi
to suppress all suppressible warnings.
.TP
.B \-hushchars
.RB ( .hushLostChars )
Causes
.B xdvi
to suppress warnings about references to characters which are not defined
in the font.
.TP
.B \-hushchecksums
.RB ( .hushChecksums )
Causes
.B xdvi
to suppress warnings about checksum mismatches between the
.I dvi
file and the font file.
.TP
#ifkpathsea
.B \-hushspecials
.RB ( .hushSpecials )
Causes
.B xdvi
to suppress warnings about
.B \especial
strings that it cannot process.
#endif
.TP
.B \-hushstdout
.RB ( .hushStdout )
Causes
.B xdvi
to suppress all status informations it would normally print to
stdout if the statusline is disabled.
.TP
.BI \-icongeometry " geometry"
.RB ( .iconGeometry )
Specifies the initial position for the icon.
.TP
.B \-iconic
.RB ( .iconic )
Causes the
.B xdvi
window to start in the iconic state.  The default is to start with the
window open.
#ifgrey
.TP
.B \-install
.RB ( .install )
If
.B xdvi
is running under a
.B PseudoColor
visual, then (by default) it will check for
.B TrueColor
visuals with more bits per pixel, and switch to such a visual if one exists.
If no such visual exists, it will use the current visual and colormap.  If
.B \-install
is selected, however, it will still use a
.B TrueColor
visual with a greater depth, if one is available; otherwise, it will
install its own colormap on the current visual.  If the current visual is not
.BR PseudoColor ,
then
.B xdvi
will not switch the visual or colormap, regardless of its options.
The default value of the
.B install
resource is the special value,
.BR maybe .
There is no
.B +install
option.  See also
.BR \-noinstall ,
and the GREYSCALING AND COLORMAPS section.
#endif
#ifghost
.TP
.BI \-interpreter " filename"
.RB ( .interpreter )
Use
.I filename
as the Ghostscript interpreter.  By default it uses
.BR @GS_PATH@ .
#endif
.TP
.B \-keep
.RB ( .keepPosition )
Sets a flag to indicate that
.B xdvi
should not move to the home position when moving to a new page.  See also the
.RB ` k '
keystroke.
.TP
.B \-l
.RB ( .listFonts )
Causes the names of the fonts used to be listed.
.TP
.BI \-margins " dimen"
.RB ( .Margin )
Specifies the size of both the top margin and side margin.
This determines the ``home'' position of the page within the window as
follows.  If the entire page fits in the window, then the margin settings
are ignored.  If, even after removing the margins from the left, right,
top, and bottom, the page still cannot fit in the window, then the page
is put in the window such that the top and left margins are hidden, and
presumably the upper left-hand corner of the text on the page will be
in the upper left-hand corner of the window.
Otherwise, the text is centered in the window.
The dimension should be a decimal number optionally followed by
any of the two-letter abbreviations for units accepted by \*(Te\&
.RB ( pt ,
.BR pc ,
.BR in ,
.BR bp ,
.BR cm ,
.BR mm ,
.BR dd ,
.BR cc ,
or
.BR sp ).
By default, the unit will be
.BR @DEFAULT_UNIT@.

.BI \-mfmode " mode-def"
#endif
#ifnokpathsea
.BI \-mfmode " mode-def\fR[\fP\fB:\fPdpi\fR]\fP"
#endif
.RB ( .mfMode )
Specifies a
.I mode-def
string, which can be used in searching for fonts (see ENVIRONMENT, below).
Generally, when changing the
.IR mode-def ,
it is also necessary to change the font size to the appropriate value
for that mode.  This is done by adding a colon and the value in dots per inch;
for example,
.BR "\-mfmode ljfour:600" .
This method overrides any value given by the
.B pixelsPerInch
resource or the
.B \-p
command-line argument.
#ifmakepk
The metafont mode is also passed to
.B metafont
during automatic creation of fonts.
#endif
By default, it is
.BR "@MFMODE@" .

Same as
.BR \-mgs1 .
.TP
.BI "\-mgs\fR[\fIn\fR]" " size"
.RB ( .magnifierSize\fR[\fIn\fR] )
Specifies the size of the window to be used for the ``magnifying glass''
for Button
.IR n .
The size may be given as an integer (indicating that the magnifying glass
is to be square), or it may be given in the form
.IR width x height .
See the MOUSE ACTIONS section.  Defaults are 200x150, 400x250, 700x500,
1000x800, and 1200x1200.
#ifdps
.TP
.B \-nodps
.RB ( .dps )
Inhibits the use of Display PostScript<tm> for displaying PostScript<tm>
specials.  Other forms of PostScript emulation, if installed, will be used
instead.
(For this option, the logic of the corresponding resource is reversed:
.B \-nodps
corresponds to
.BR dps:off ;
.B +nodps
to
.BR dps:on .)
#endif
#ifghost

.B \-noghostscript
.RB ( .ghostscript )
Inhibits the use of Ghostscript for displaying PostScript<tm> specials.

.B \-nogrey
.RB ( .grey )
Turns off the use of greyscale anti-aliasing when printing shrunken bitmaps.

.BR grey:off ;
.B +nogrey
to

#ifghost
.TP
.B \-nogssafer
.RB ( .gsSafer )
Normally, if Ghostscript is used to render PostScript specials, the Ghostscript
interpreter is run with the option
.BR \-dSAFER .
The
.B \-nogssafer
option runs Ghostscript without
.BR \-dSAFER .
The
.B \-dSAFER
option in Ghostscript disables PostScript operators such as
.BR deletefile ,
to prevent possibly malicious PostScript programs from having any effect.
If the
.B \-safer
option is specified, then this option has no effect; in that case Ghostscript
is always run with
.BR \-dSAFER .
(For the
.B \-nogssafer
option, the logic of the corresponding resource is reversed:
.B \-nogssafer
corresponds to

.BI \-offsets " dimen"
.RB ( .Offset )
Specifies the size of both the horizontal and vertical offsets of the
output on the page.  By decree of the Stanford \*(Te\& Project,
the default \*(Te\& page origin is always 1 inch over and down from
the top-left page corner, even when non-American paper sizes are used.
Therefore, the default offsets are 1.0 inch.
The argument
.I dimen
should be a decimal number optionally followed by any of the two-letter
abbreviations for units accepted by \*(Te\&
.RB ( pt ,
.BR pc ,
.BR in ,
.BR bp ,
.BR cm ,
.BR mm ,
.BR dd ,
.BR cc ,
or

By default, the unit will be
.BR @DEFAULT_UNIT@.
See also
.B \-xoffset
and
.BR \-yoffset .
.TP
.BI \-p " pixels"
.RB ( .pixelsPerInch )
Defines the size of the fonts to use, in pixels per inch.  The
default value is @BDPI@.  This option is provided only for backwards
compatibility; the preferred way of setting the font size is by setting the
Metafont mode at the same time; see the
.B \-mfmode
option.
.TP
.BI \-paper " papertype"
.RB ( .paper )
Specifies the size of the printed page.  This may be of the form
\fIwidth\fBx\fIheight\fR optionally followed by a unit, where
.I width
and
.I height
are decimal numbers giving the width and height of the paper, respectively,
and the unit is any of the two-letter abbreviations for units accepted
by \*(Te\&
.RB ( pt ,
.BR pc ,
.BR in ,
.BR bp ,
.BR cm ,
.BR mm ,

.B foolscap
(13.5x17in),
as well as the ISO sizes
.BR a1 - a7 ,

.B \-rv
.RB ( .reverseVideo )
Causes the page to be displayed with white characters on a black background,

.BI \-s " shrink"
.RB ( .shrinkFactor )
Defines the initial shrink factor.  The default value is @SHRINK@.  If

.BI \-shrinkbutton "n shrink"
.RB ( .shrinkButton\fIn\fP )
Specifies that the

.IR factor .
This is useful, e.g., when using 600 dpi fonts, since in that case shrinking
by a factor of 4 is still not enough.  Here
.I n
may be a number from 1 to 3 (in the default button layout, the ``Full Size''
button is unaffected by these options).  If the buttons are customized,
higher values of

.B \-thorough
.RB ( .thorough )
.B xdvi
will usually try to ensure that overstrike characters

are printed correctly.  On monochrome displays, this is always possible
with one logical operation, either
.I and

.IR or .
On color displays, however, this may take two operations, one to set the
appropriate bits and one to clear other bits.  If this is the case, then
by default
.B xdvi
will instead use the

.SH MOUSE ACTIONS
If the shrink factor is set to any number other than one, then clicking
#ifkpathsea
mouse button 3 
#endif
#ifnokpathsea
any mouse button
#endif
will pop up a ``magnifying glass'' which shows the unshrunk
image in the vicinity of the mouse click.  This subwindow disappears when
the mouse button is released.  Different mouse buttons produce different sized
windows, as indicated by the
.B \-mgs
option.  Moving the mouse cursor while holding the button down will move the
magnifying glass. To access this feature via customization, use the
.B magnifier
action.  Its argument is either a string of the form
.IR width x height ,
as in the
.BI \-mgs n
command-line option, or one of the strings
.B *1
through
.BR *5 ,
referring to the value specified by the corresponding
.BI \-mgs n
option. Note that in order to assign magnifier actions to
the buttons 4 or 5, you need to use the resource
.B wheelTranslations
(more about this resource below), e.g.:
.RS 5
.nf
.ft 3
.sp 1n
xdvi.wheelTranslations: <Btn4Down>: magnifier(*4)\\n\\
    <Btn5Down>:	magnifier(*5)\\n
.sp 1n

.RE
.PP
Holding down the
.I CTRL
key and clicking on mouse button 1 starts a ``reverse search''
(action \fB source-special()\fR; see the section on SOURCE SPECIALS for details).
.PP
The scrollbars (if present) behave in the standard way:  pushing Button 2
in a scrollbar moves the top or left edge of the scrollbar to that point
and optionally drags it;
pushing Button 1 moves the image up or right by an amount equal to the distance
from the button press to the upper left-hand corner of the window; pushing
Button 3 moves the image down or left by the same amount.
.PP
The image can also be dragged around, by holding down the shift key
and a mouse button.  Shift-button 1 allows dragging in all directions,
Shift-button 2 allows vertical dragging only, and Shift-button 3
horizontal dragging only. To access these actions via customization, use the
.B drag
action.  This action should have one parameter, the character
.RB `` | '',
.RB `` - '',
or
.RB `` + '',
indicating vertical dragging, horizontal dragging, or dragging in both
directions.
.PP
Wheel mice are supported:  motion of the wheel on such a mouse moves the
image up or down by the number of pixels indicated by the
.B \-wheelunit
option.  To access this option via customization, use the
.B wheel
action.  This action takes one parameter, giving the distance to scroll
the image.  If the parameter contains a decimal point, the distance is given
in wheel units; otherwise, pixels.
#ifhyper
.SH HYPERLINKS
Usually, if a binding specifies more then one action, all actions
are executed in a sequence. The hyperlink bindings
.B do-href()
and
.B do-href-newwindow()
are special in that they are used as an
.I alternative
to other actions that might follow them
.I if
the mouse is currently located on a hyperlink.
In this case, none of the other actions will be executed.
Otherwise,
.I only
the other actions are executed.
The action
.B do-href()
jumps to the link target in the current xdvi
window (possibly changing the page), and
.B do-href-newwindow()
opens a new instance of xdvi
with the link target. In both cases, the location of the target is
indicated by a small arrow drawn in
.B highlight
color
in the left corner of the window.
.PP
As an example, consider the following settings, which are the default
settings for buttons 1 and 2:
.RS 5
.nf
.ft 3
.sp 1n
xdvi.mainTranslations: #override \\
<Btn1Down>: do-href()magnifier(*1)\\n\\

The fact that the mouse is located over a hyperlink is indicated by
(a) changing the pointer to a hand shape, and (b) displaying the link
target in the statusline at the bottom of the window.
.PP
If a link points to a file which is not a DVI file (e.g. HTML, or
PostScript), the files
.B mime.types

.B mailcap
are parsed to determine a suitable viewer; if no suitable
.B mailcap
entry was found, if the
.SB WWWBROWSER
environment variable is set, or
.B \-browser
was specified on the command line, the browser is launched to load the file.
#endif
#iftool
.SH UNBOUND ACTIONS
The following actions have not been assigned any keystroke, but are available
if customization is used.
.TP
.B shrink-to-dpi()
This action takes one (required) argument.  It sets the shrink factor to
an integer so as to approximate the use of fonts with the corresponding
number of dots per inch.  If
.B xdvi
is using fonts scaled for
.I p
dots per inch, and the argument to
.B shrink-to-dpi
is
.IR n ,
then the corresponding shrink factor is the ratio
.IR p / n ,
rounded to the nearest integer.
.SH CUSTOMIZATION
Key and mouse button assignments can be changed by setting the
.B mainTranslations
resource to a string of translations as defined in the documentation for the
X toolkit.  The actions should take the form of action names as given in the
KEYSTROKES and MOUSE ACTIONS sections.
.PP
Key actions will usually be without arguments, or they may give an argument
to replace an optional number typed immediately prior to the action.  The keys
.BR 0 \- 9
and hyphen cannot be reassigned, since they are used for inputting numbers.
.PP
Some key actions may take special arguments, as follows. The argument of
.B goto-page
may be the letter
.RB ` e ',
indicating the action of going to the end of the document.
The argument of
.B set-shrink-factor
may be the letter
.RB ` a ',
indicating that the shrink factor should be set to the smallest value such that
the page will fit in the window.
Finally, actions that would perform a toggle, such as
.BR set-keep-flag ,
may be the letter
.RB ` t ',
indicating that the action should toggle regardless of what number may have
been typed recently.
.PP
Mouse actions should refer only to
.B ButtonPress
events (e.g.,
.BR "<Btn1Down>:magnifier(*1)" ).
The corresponding motion and release events will then be handled internally.
A key action may be bound to a mouse event, but not vice versa.
.PP
Usually the string of translations should begin with
.RB `` #override '',
indicating that the default key and mouse button assignments should not
be discarded.
.PP
When keys or mouse buttons involving modifiers (such as Ctrl or Shift)
are customized together with their non-modified equivalents, the modified
keys should come first, for example:
.RS 5
.nf
.ft 3
.sp 1n
xdvi.mainTranslations: #override \\
Ctrl<Btn1Down>: magnifier(*3)\\n\\
Shift<Btn1Down>: magnifier(*2)\\n\\
<Btn1Down>: magnifier(*1)\\n
.sp 1n
.ft
.fi
.RE
.PP
Because
.B xdvi
needs to capture pointer motion events, and because the X Toolkit
translations mechanism cannot accommodate both motion events and double-click
events at the same time, it is not possible to specify double-click
actions in
.B xdvi
customizations.  For information on this and other aspects of translations,
see the X Toolkit Intrinsics documentation.
.PP
There is no command-line option to set the
.B mainTranslations
resource, since changing this resource on the command line would be cumbersome.
To set the resource for testing purposes, use the
.B -xrm
command-line option provided by the X toolkit.  For example,
\fBxdvi \-xrm 'XDvi.mainTranslations: #override "z":quit()' ...\fR
or
.B "xdvi \-xrm 'XDvi.mainTranslations: #override <Key>z:quit()' ..."
will cause the key
.RB ` z '
to quit
.BR xdvi .
.PP
Support of wheel mice is controlled by the
.B wheelTranslations
resource.  Generally the only action routine called by this resource should be
.BR wheel .
The default value is
``\fB<Btn4Down>:wheel(-1.)\\n<Btn5Down>:wheel(1.)\fR''.
Because this resource is implemented differently from the others, it should
not begin with
.RB ``#override '';
when specifying a value for this resource, all wheel actions should be
included.
#
#ifbuttons
.PP
The button labels and actions may also be customized, in a similar manner.
In this case the resource
.B buttonTranslations
should consist of a string describing the button labels and the associated
actions.  The string consists of substrings, separated by the newline
character
(`\fB\\n\fP'),
each describing one button.  Each substring consists of a string (to be
used as the button's label), a colon, and a sequence of actions to be
performed when the button is pushed.  Unlike the situation with key actions,
an action associated to a button should provide an argument (if applicable).
.PP
The default setting is as follows:
.RS 5

The label string may contain a colon if it is escaped by a backslash
(`\fB\\\fP').  It also may contain some special sequences tied to the
.BI \-shrinkbutton n
command-line options.  If the characters
.RB ` $# '
occur, then they are replaced by the argument of the corresponding
.B \-shrinkbutton
command-line option (if present).  If no corresponding
.B \-shrinkbutton
option was given, then the value is taken from the list of actions, which
is expected to contain at least one
.B set-shrink-factor
or
.B shrink-to-dpi
action.  Likewise, the character sequence
.RB ` $% '
will be replaced by the percentage corresponding to the shrink factor,
determined as above.  In order for the
.B \-shrinkbutton
option to affect a given button, the label string must contain one of the
character sequences
.RB ` $# ',
.RB ` $% ',
or
.RB ' $_ '.
This last string flags a button to be affected by a
.B \-shrinkbutton
option, without making any numbers appear in the label text (the
.RB ` $_ '
will not appear in the label text).
.PP
Some resources are provided to allow customization of the geometry of
the command buttons.  Again, they are not changeable via command-line
options, other than via the
.B \-xrm
option.  All of these resources take integer values.
.TP
.B buttonSideSpacing
The number of pixels to be placed on either side of the buttons.
The default value is 6.
.TP
.B buttonTopSpacing
The number of pixels between the top button and the top of the window.
The default value is 50.
.TP
.B buttonBetweenSpacing
The number of pixels between most buttons.
The default value is 20.
.TP
.B buttonBetweenExtra
The number of pixels of additional space to be inserted if the
.B buttonTranslations
resource string contains an extra newline character.
The default value is 50.
.TP
.B buttonBorderWidth
The border width of the button windows.  The default value is 1.

.SH SIGNALS

receives a
.SB SIGUSR1
signal, it rereads the
.I dvi

.SH GREYSCALING AND COLORMAPS
The greyscale anti-aliasing feature in
.B xdvi
will not work at its best if the display does not have enough colors available.
This can happen if other applications are using most of the colormap
(even if they are iconified).  If this occurs, then
.B xdvi
will print an error message and turn on the
.B -copy
option.  This will result in overstrike characters appearing wrong;
it may also result in poor display quality if the number of available
colors is very small.
.PP
Typically this problem occurs on displays that allocate eight bits
of video memory per pixel.  To see how many bits per pixel your display
uses, type
.B xwininfo
in an
.B xterm
window, and then click the mouse on the root window when asked.  The
``Depth:'' entry will tell you how many bits are allocated per pixel.
.PP
Displays using at least 15 bits per pixel are typically
.B TrueColor
visuals, which do not have this problem, since their colormap is
permanently allocated and available to all applications.  (The visual
class is also displayed by
.BR xwininfo .)
For more information on visual classes see the documentation for the
X Window System.
.PP
To alleviate this problem, therefore, one may (a) run with more bits
per pixel (this may require adding more video memory or replacing the video
card), (b) shut down other applications that may be using much of the colormap
and then restart
.BR xdvi ,
or (c) run
.B xdvi
with the
.B \-install
option.
.PP
One application which is often the cause of this problem is
.BR Netscape .
In this case there are two more alternatives to remedying the situation.
One can run
.RB `` "netscape -install" ''
to cause
.B Netscape
to install a private colormap.  This can cause colors to change in
bizarre ways when the mouse is moved to a different window.
Or, one can run
.RB `` "netscape -ncols 220" ''
to limit
.B Netscape
to a smaller number of colors.  A smaller number will ensure that
other applications have more colors available, but will degrade the
color quality in the
.B Netscape
window.

.SH HANDLING OF POSTSCRIPT FIGURES
.B xdvi
can display Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files included in the
.I dvi
file.  Such files are first searched for in the directory where the
.I dvi
file is, and then using normal
.B Kpathsea
rules.  There is an exception to this, however:  if the file name begins
with a backtick
.RB ( ` ),
then the remaining characters in the file name give a shell command (often
.BR zcat )
which is executed; its standard output is then sent to be interpreted as
PostScript.  Note that there is some potential for security problems here;
see the
.B \-allowshell
command-line option.  It is better to use compressed files directly (see below).
.PP
If a file name is given (as opposed to a shell command),
if that file name ends in
.RB `` .Z ''
or
.RB `` .gz '',
and if the first two bytes of the file indicate that it was compressed with
.BR compress (1)
or
.BR gzip (1),
respectively, then the file is first uncompressed with
.B uncompress \-c
or
.BR "gunzip \-c" ,
respectively.  This is preferred over using a backtick to call the command
directly, since you do not have to specify
.B \-allowshell
and since it allows for path searching.

.SH T1LIB
T1Lib is a library written by Rainer Menzner (see ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/);
using it,
.B xdvi
can now render Postscript<tm> Type1 fonts directly, without the
route via TeX pixel
.RB ( pk )
fonts. The advantage of this is that only one size of each font needs
to be kept on disk.
Unless the
.B -not1lib
option is used,
.B xdvi
will try to render every font using T1Lib. Only as a fallback, it will
invoke an external program (like
.BR mktexpk ,
which in turn might invoke utilities like
.B ps2pk
or
.BR gsftopk )
to generate a pixel font from the Type1 source. The direct rendering
of the
.B Computer Modern
fonts should work out-of-the box, whereas other Type1 fonts such as
the 35 `standard' Postscript<tm> fonts resident in printers might need
to be made accessible for use with T1Lib/xdvi, unless your system
administrator has already done so. The
.B xdvik
distribution comes with a utility called
.B t1mapper
to make these fonts visible for T1Lib/xdvi.
See the manual page for t1mapper(1) for details
on how to use this utility.

.SH SOURCE SPECIALS
Some \*(Te\& implementations or macro packages provide the facility to
automatically include so-called `source specials' into a .dvi file.
These contain the line number, eventually a column number, and the
filename of the .tex source. This makes it possible to jump from a .dvi
file to the corresponding place in the .tex source and back (also
called `reverse search' and `forward search').
.P
To be usable with
.BR xdvi ,
source specials in the
.I dvi
file must have one of the following formats:
.RS 5
.nf
.sp 1n
    \fBsrc:\fP\fIline\fP[ ]\fIfilename\fP
    \fBsrc:\fP\fIline\fP\fB:\fP\fIcol\fP[ ]\fIfilename\fP
    \fBsrc:\fP\fIline\fP
    \fBsrc:\fP\fIline\fP\fB:\fP\fIcol\fP
    \fBsrc::\fP\fIcol\fP
.sp 1n
.fi
.RE
If
.I filename
or
.I line
are omitted, the most recent values are used.  The first source special on
each page must be in one of the first two forms, since defaults are not
inherited across pages.
.sp
You will need a \*(Te\& implementation or a macro package
(such as
.I srcltx.sty
or
.I srctex.sty
, available from CTAN)
to insert such source specials into the dvi file.
.sp
For reverse search, you can use the combination
.I CTRL-Mouse 1
to make xdvi open an editor (the value of the
.I \-editor
command line option) with the file and the line number of the .tex
source. (See the description of the
.I \-editor
option for more information
and examples.)
.P
For forward search,
.B xdvi
has a
.I \-sourceposition
option that makes
.B xdvi
jump  jump to the page in
the .dvi file corresponding to the line number and the file name
and highlight the line found. See the description of the
.I \-sourceposition
for more details.
.sp
The evaluation of source specials is disabled when the
.BR \-safer
option is used.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B xdvik
uses the same environment variables and algorithms for finding
font files as \*(Te\& and friends.  See the documentation for the
.B Kpathsea
library for details (repeating it here is too cumbersome).  In addition,
.B xdvik
accepts the following variables:
.TP
.SB DISPLAY
Specifies which graphics display terminal to use.
#ifnokpathsea
.TP
.SB XDVISIZES
A list of font resolutions separated by colons.  If a font cannot be found
or made at its stated size, then these sizes are tried as a fallback.
See the `Fallback font' section in the
.B Kpathsea
manual for more details.
.B xdvi
tries the actual size of the font before trying any of the given sizes.
Each font resolution should be a positive integer, specifying the number
of dots per inch, or a string of the form
.BR magstep\fIn\fP ,
where
.I n
is a number -9.5, -9, -8.5, ..., 8, 8.5, 9, or 9.5.  The string
.B magstep
may be shortened to any non-empty initial substring (so that
.B magstep0.5
may be shortened to
.B mag0.5
or
.B m0.5
(but not
.BR mag.5 )).
The entries
.BI magstep n
signify the current pixels-per-inch value, multiplied by 1.2 raised to the
.IR n th
power, and rounded to the nearest integer.
If the list begins with a colon, the system default sizes are used, as well.
Sizes are expressed in dots per inch and must be integers.
The current default set of sizes is @DEFAULT_FONT_SIZES@.

.SH LIMITATIONS
.B xdvi
accepts many but not all types of PostScript specials accepted by
.BR dvips .
For example, it accepts most specials generated by
.B epsf
and
.BR psfig .
It does not, however, support
.B bop\-hook
or
.BR eop\-hook ,
nor does it allow PostScript commands to affect the rendering of things that
are not PostScript (for example, the ``NEAT'' and rotated ``A'' examples in the
.B dvips
manual).  These restrictions are due to the design of
.BR xdvi ;
in all likelihood they will always remain.
.PP
La\*(Te\&2e color and rotation specials are not currently supported.

.B MetaPost
files containing included text are not supported.

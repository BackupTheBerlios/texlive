%
% Users of teTeX > 1.0 should use this file instead of xdvi.cfg.
% Rename it to xdvi.cfg and copy it as described in the INSTALL file.
% This file ps2pk.map which will automatically be updated by the `updmap'
% script.

%
% =============== Section 1: Encodings
%
% Here we list all the encodings we want xdvi to recognize as an
% "implied" encoding.  This means that ptmr8r will be recognized as
% ptmr encoded with 8r and ptmr8y as ptmr encoded with 8y.  If the font file
% we want to encode with 8r is named ptmr8a, however, this must be listed in
% the map file entry.

% NOTE: the enc files used by xdvi are similar to those used by dvips,
% whith the important exception that xdvi _cannot_ parse postscript,
% so the vectors mustn't require postscript execution.

%	Suffix	Encoding name		Defined by this file
enc	8r	TeXBase1Encoding	8r.enc
enc	8c	CorkEncoding		cork.enc
enc	8y	TeXnANSIEncoding	texnansi.enc

%
% =============== Section 2: Map files
%
% Multiple .map files are allowed. If a font entry is found in several
% files, later entries will override earlier ones (and a warning
% will be printed to stderr). 

% ps2pk has no "built-in" fonts, just like xdvik. We can use its map file.
dvipsmap ps2pk.map

% Users of teTeX-1.0 should use the following combination of map files:
%dvipsmap psfonts.map
%dvipsmap ps2pk.map

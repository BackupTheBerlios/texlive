.TH TEXDOCTK 1
.SH NAME
texdoctk \- GUI for easier access of TeX package and program documentations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B texdoctk
-[\-aq]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B texdoctk
is a GUI for easier access of a large part of the vast amount
of package and program documentations and tutorials for TeX and its
different derivates (mainly LaTeX).
.PP
The documentation is grouped into 17 categories; the 18th button of the main
panel is inactive by default. If you have special documents which do not fit
into any of the categories, you can append an 18th block to texdoctk-local.dat
with the respective entries.
.PP
In the settings window you see a checkbox in the html->ps and text->ps
converter menus for switching on/off output redirect. This is due to the fact
that some converters do not write their output into a file but to stdout by
default, so a redirect is needed, e.g.
.PP
a2ps myfile.txt >myfile.ps
.SS "OPTIONS"
.TP
.I "\-q"
quiet: enable suppression of some viewer messages which are otherwise sent
to stderr. This can also be set in a configuration file.
.TP
.I "\-a"
autoview: autostart viewer if a listbox contains only one item (this will
frequently happen in search results). This can also be set in a configuration
file.

.SH BUGS
Widget placement in topic toplevels becomes ugly when the toplevel is stretched
or shrunk.
.PP
The font in the frame labels of the Settings menu are not forced to the default
font; this will become visible e.g. at hi-res screens, where the label font is
not scaled up.
.PP
Netscape and Mozilla error output will be written to stderr even if the quiet mode was set.
.SS "VERSION"
The current version of texdoctk is 0.5.2 beta 2 (19 February, 2002)
